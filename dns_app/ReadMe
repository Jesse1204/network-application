This application is a simple Flask implementation of DNS protocol, consisting of 
user server, Fibonacci server and authoritative server.
Fibonacci server registers its hostname and ip address at authoritative server.
When user comes up with a request of getting fibonacci number, user server queries
authoritative server for the ip address of fibonacci server. Then it sends request to
fibonacci server for the calculation result and return it.

Authoritative server receive and respond to queries with UDP connection.
